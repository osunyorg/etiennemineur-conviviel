        <p>This is a list of small, free, or experimental tools that might be useful in building your game / website / interactive project. Although I've included'standards', this list has a focus on artful tools and toys that are as fun to use as they are functional. The goal of this list is to enable making entirely outside of closed production ecosystems or walled software gardens.</p>
